* Obvious Parentheses
Have you ever thought that subtle coloring of Rainbow Delimiters is not enough? Here is my solution that works quite well on dark backgrounds.
** Usage
To try it, download it and install the *.el file using:
M-x package-install-file

go to scratch buffer

type (((((())))))

enable rainbow-delimiters-mode
M-x obvious-parentheses-colorize

if you like it you can add
(obvious-parentheses-colorize)
to your Emacs start-up file

** Deletion
Once you have tried you can remove with:
M-x package-delete
then select obvious-delimiters-0.11
